//Objective
The fundamental data types in c are int, float and char. Today, we're discussing int and float data types.

The printf() function prints the given statement to the console. The syntax is printf("format string",argument_list);. In the function, if we are using an integer, character, string or float as argument, then in the format string we have to write %d (integer), %c (character), %s (string), %f (float) respectively.

The scanf() function reads the input data from the console. The syntax is scanf("format string",argument_list);. For ex: The scanf("%d",&number) statement reads integer number from the console and stores the given value in variable number.

To input two integers separated by a space on a single line, the command is scanf("%d %d", &n, &m), where n and m are the two integers.

Task
Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum:

1.Declare 4 variables: two of type int and two of type float.
2.Read 2 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your 4 variables.
3.Use the + and - operator to perform the following operations:
>Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.
>Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.//

{
	
 int a,b;
    float x,y;
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
    scanf("%f%f",&x,&y);
    printf("%d %d \n",a+b,a-b);
    printf("%0.1f %0.1f",x+y,x-y);
    
    return 0;
